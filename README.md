First line: A short description of the project, used as a subtitle or tagline

Remaining lines: a verbose changelog of what makes this "git version" different from the last.
Use this space (in Markdown format) to describe the context and details of the changes.
This section should be 5 to 20 lines of interesting detail; each version tab in the project will
