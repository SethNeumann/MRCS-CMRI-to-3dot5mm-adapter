First line: A short description of the project, used as a subtitle ot tagline

Remaining lines: a verbose changelog of what makes this "git version" different from the last.
Use this space (in Markdown format) to describe the context and details of the changes.
This section should be 5 to 20 lines of interesting detail; each version tab in the project will 
display this text to help the reader understand why this version is differnet...

The published project on the SPCoast.github.io website will
include the relevant git commit messages as a terse, high level
changelog, so don't replicate those messages here.
